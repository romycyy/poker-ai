# Hierarchical Information Abstraction Algorithm (Refined)
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Inputs:
#   R       - Total number of rounds (e.g., Preflop, Flop, Turn, River)
#   r_hat   - The special round where public clustering is performed (e.g., Flop)
#   C       - Desired number of public clusters (buckets)
#   B_r     - Number of private clusters per public bucket for rounds r â‰¥ r_hat
#   A_r     - Abstraction algorithm used for clustering (for both initial and later private clustering)
#
# Outputs:
#   clusters - A dictionary mapping each public cluster (bucket) to its private clustering for rounds r_hat to R
